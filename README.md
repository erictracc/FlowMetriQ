## Overview

**FlowMetriQ** is a local, interactive **Process Mining & Simulation tool** designed to analyze, visualize, and experiment with real-world event logs.

Built using:

- **Python (Dash + Flask)**
- **MongoDB**
- **Plotly Graphs**
- **Monte-Carlo Simulation Engine**

It allows users to:

✔ Upload and manage event logs                                          
✔ Explore bottlenecks and performance issues  
✔ Visualize timelines and statistical distributions  
✔ Run simulations with activity duration interventions  
✔ Compare baseline vs simulated process outcomes  

All data is stored **locally** using your MongoDB instance, nothing is cloud-hosted.

## Process Analysis & Insights

FlowMetriQ is designed not only to visualize event logs, but to **support structured process analysis and decision-making**. Using the application, analysts can systematically uncover inefficiencies and formulate actionable recommendations.

### What the Application Enables

Using FlowMetriQ, we can:

- Visualize the **end-to-end claim-handling process**
- Identify:
  - Bottlenecks
  - Delays
  - Rework loops
  - Repetitions
- Inspect individual cases in detail
- Validate data quality issues
- Make **evidence-based process improvement recommendations**

---

## Application Core Requirements Checklist

FlowMetriQ satisfies the following core process mining requirements:

- ✔ Directly-Follows Graph (DFG) generation  
- ✔ Interactive visualizations  
- ✔ Case viewer with filters  
- ✔ Bottleneck detection  
- ✔ Basic statistics dashboard  
- ✔ Case timelines  
- ✔ Duration distributions and boxplots  

---

## Demonstrated Process Insights

### Rework Loops (Internally Pending Events)

Rework loops, such as repeated *internally pending* events, are a strong indicator of inefficiency.

<img width="1588" height="977" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-12 002104" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaaf9bbc-d23a-46d8-92f9-f7629d7c57d6" />

- On the **Analysis page**, filtering by the *internally pending* activity reveals:
  - High frequency
  - Elevated median and average durations
- In **Additional Visual Insights**, this event has the **highest count**
- Its **boxplot is highly skewed**, indicating long-tail delays

<img width="1585" height="1192" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-12 000629" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8878ff8-4392-4d02-8ff3-104f48abd313" />


**Interpretation:**  
This suggests repeated internal handoffs or unresolved dependencies, making it a prime candidate for process redesign.

---

### Longest Cases

FlowMetriQ enables deep inspection of long-running cases:

- The **Case Timeline feature** visualizes how each activity unfolds over time
- This allows analysts to:
  - Select the longest case (by total duration or number of events)
  - Understand which activities contribute most to delays

<img width="1582" height="1198" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-12 000710" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1781e4cd-5ecd-40f2-ba4b-c954f652edd7" />


**Use Case:**  
After identifying extreme cases through statistical analysis, those cases can be visually inspected to understand *why* they took longer.

---

### Timestamp Anomalies & Ordering Issues

In **Additional Visual Insights**, users can inspect:

- Event frequencies
- Direct successorship relationships

This helps identify:
- Unexpected activity ordering
- Timestamp inconsistencies
- Potential logging or automation artifacts

**Example:**  
If an approval event consistently precedes data collection, this may indicate data recording issues.

---

### Negative Durations

Some activities initially appeared with **negative durations**.

**Handling decision:**
- Negative durations were treated as **data entry or logging errors**
- These records were removed from the analysis

**Implications:**
- Certain variants may no longer be representable
- Artificial variants could appear or disappear

**Alternative approaches considered:**
- Converting negative values to positive
- Consulting stakeholders to interpret their semantic meaning

---

### Activities with Very Few Duration Values

Some activities appear only once or a handful of times, resulting in unusual boxplots.

**Observed effects:**
- No visible box (Q1 = median = Q3)
- Single dots or flat lines
- Sparse distributions

**Examples:**
- Paid  
- Review Completed  
- Reviewed Documentation  

**Why this happens:**
- Rare event types  
- Automated activities (often duration = 0)  
- Activities occurring in very few cases  

**Important Note:**  
Boxplots require **multiple observations** to display meaningful quartiles. Sparse activities should be interpreted cautiously.

---

## From Analysis to Simulation

Insights discovered during analysis directly inform the **Simulation Engine**:

- Bottleneck activities can be targeted for:
  - Deterministic duration changes
  - Speedups
  - Slowdowns
- Simulation results quantify:
  - Expected improvement
  - Distributional changes
  - Risk of unintended delays

This closes the loop between **diagnosis → intervention → evaluation**.

## Environment Setup (Safe Local Version)

### 1. Create a `.env` file

```python
MONGO_URI=mongodb://admin:YOURPASSWORD@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin
MONGO_DB=flowmetriq
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8050
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_here
```

> `.env` is ignored by git, credentials are never uploaded.

---

### 2. Configuration Loader Example

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

settings = {
    "database_uri": os.getenv("MONGO_URI"),
    "database_name": os.getenv("MONGO_DB"),
    "host": os.getenv("HOST", "127.0.0.1"),
    "port": int(os.getenv("PORT", 8050)),
    "secret_key": os.getenv("SECRET_KEY"),
}
```

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/erictracc/FlowMetriQ.git
cd FlowMetriQ
```

Create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start MongoDB locally
(Make sure MongoDB is running before launching FlowMetriQ.)

Run the application:

```
python app.py
```

Open your browser:

```
http://localhost:PORT
```

## Event Log Format

FlowMetriQ expects event logs in CSV format with the following minimum columns:

- `CASE_ID` = Unique identifier for each process instance
- `ACTIVITY` = Name of the executed activity
- `START TIME` = Timestamp when the activity started
- `END TIME` = Timestamp when the activity ended

Additional columns (e.g., resource, team, cost) are supported but optional.

**Example:**

| CASE_ID | ACTIVITY            | START TIME           | END TIME             |
|--------:|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1001    | Submit Claim        | 2023-01-01 09:12:00  | 2023-01-01 09:15:00  |
| 1001    | Internally Pending  | 2023-01-01 09:15:00  | 2023-01-03 14:22:00  |

Timestamps are parsed using Pandas and must be in a valid datetime format.

## Security & Privacy

- All data is processed **locally**
- No event logs are transmitted or stored externally
- MongoDB runs on the user's local machine
- Authentication is optional and intended for demonstration purposes only

This design ensures sensitive operational or claims data never leaves the local environment.

## Known Limitations

- Designed for **educational and analytical use**, not production deployment
- Large event logs may impact performance due to in-memory processing
- Simulation results depend on historical behavior and assumptions
- Markov routing does not capture long-term dependencies across cases

These limitations are intentional and aligned with the project’s academic scope.

## Future Improvements

- Conformance checking against reference models
- Resource-aware simulation
- Cost-based performance metrics
- Automated bottleneck recommendations
- Variant comparison and clustering
